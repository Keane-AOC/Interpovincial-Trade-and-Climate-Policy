# Interpovincial Trade and Climate Policy
Three main stakeholders come to mind when discussing this topic. 

The first is the federal government in Canada, as this stakeholder represents the main authority and decision-making entity in Canada. The primary motivation for the federal government—also shared by the other stakeholders involved, although there are some minor differences—is to achieve overall prosperity and success for Canada. The federal government also has a commitment to the broader international community due to the multiple climate commitments Canada has been a part of.

The second key stakeholder is the provincial governments within Canada. Provinces within Canada have constitutional power over the resources within their borders. As a result of this, decisions surrounding the environment in Canada must be made through a collaboration between provincial and federal governments. 

The last key stakeholder is the Canadian population—more specifically, the populations of each province and those that would be impacted by the installation of green energy projects. This group is also further broken down into two sub-groups, with the Canadian population being separated into the "general Canadian" population and the First Nations communities that live throughout Canada.
