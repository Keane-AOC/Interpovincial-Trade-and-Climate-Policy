# Background
Canada's transition to green energy presents the nation with a complex policy challenge shaped by geography, constitutional structure, and distinct provincial interests. Despite Canada's commitment to national and international climate targets, it has struggled due to discrepancies in green energy infrastructure between the provinces. Despite goals of increasing interprovincial trade to make up for these discrepancies, limited energy transmission capacity restricts the ability to move clean energy between provinces.

In the past, Canada's electricity grid was focused on North-south movement, prioritizing trade with the United States (US), instead of the East-West movement that would lead to more integrated trade between Canadian provinces. This structure followed the constitutional rights that the provinces have over their natural resources. However, this structure that has been in place since the beginning of Canada has led to uneven infrastructure and missed opportunities due to conflicting interests.

Due to recent geopolitical tensions between the US and Canada, the federal government has started to tease the idea of increased interprovincial trade, especially when it comes to energy. However, there are concerns brought by the provinces that make this goal difficult to achieve. For example, the province of Nova Scotia has previously attempted to connect grids with other provinces, but halted the project due to the rapid increase in energy costs that would occur as a result. A hasty decision-making process has the potential to negatively impact all stakeholders involved, but especially the Canadian population, who would be crushed under the continued rising costs of living.

In response to the various challenges, two broad policy approaches have emerged. One approach emphasizes decentralized, province-by-province clean energy development, focusing on renewable generation, storage, and grid upgrades within individual provinces. This strategy offers faster deployment and clearer jurisdictional control, but risks reinforcing fragmentation and increasing long-term system costs. An alternative approach prioritizes interprovincial electricity grid integration, using federal investment and coordination to expand transmission infrastructure and enable the sharing of clean power across regions. While this strategy promises greater long-term efficiency and emissions reductions, it faces high upfront costs, long timelines, and resistance from provinces concerned about autonomy and uneven distribution of benefits.

This project examines how the federal government should navigate these competing interests and structural constraints when allocating climate and infrastructure funding. By comparing the long-term implications of interprovincial grid integration and decentralized provincial development, the analysis seeks to inform a decision that balances emissions reduction, economic prosperity, political feasibility, and equity across Canada.
# Key Stakeholders
Three main stakeholders come to mind when discussing this topic.

The first is the federal government in Canada, as this stakeholder represents the main authority and decision-making entity in Canada. The primary motivation for the federal governmentis to achieve overall prosperity and success for Canada. This goal is also shared by the other stakeholders involved, although there are some minor differences as to what that means. The federal government also has a commitment to the broader international community due to the multiple climate commitments Canada has been a part of.

The second key stakeholder is the provincial governments within Canada. Provinces within Canada have constitutional power over the resources within their borders. As a result of this, decisions surrounding the environment in Canada must be made through a collaboration between provincial and federal governments. The provinces have an added interest, along with the prosperity of Canada, that being the prosperity of the provinces themselves. Typically, the leaders of each province will view their province as being properous meaning that Canada overall will be prosperous. This mentality will inevitably cause conflict with the federal government, as a decision must be reached that does not hurt one province while benefiting another.

The last key stakeholder is the Canadian population—more specifically, the populations of each province and those that would be impacted by the installation of green energy projects. This group is also further broken down into two sub-groups, with the Canadian population being separated into the “general Canadian” population and the First Nations communities that live throughout Canada. The "general Canadian" population is focused on individual economic prosperity—e.g., affordable goods, positive housing market, etc. This stakeholder is also focused on the broader prosperity of Canada, due to the mentality that a prosperous Canada means a prosperous Canadian. This mentallity is somewhat shared by the First-Nations population in Canada. They are focused on their individual prosperity, but there is the additional factor of their prosperity as First-Nations. This added layer means that decisions must respect First-Nations rights.

This mix of stakeholders and their various priorities can result in conflicts if navigated poorly.
