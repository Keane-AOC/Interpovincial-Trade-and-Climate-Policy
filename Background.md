# Background
Canada's transition to green energy presents the nation with a complex policy challenge shaped by geography, consitutional structure, and distinct provincial interests. Despite Canada's commitment to national and international cliamte targets it has struggled due to discrepancies in green energy infrastructure between the provinces. Despite goals of increasing interprovincial trade to make up for these discrepancies, limited energy transmission capacity restricts the ability to move clean energy between provinces.
# Key Stakeholders
Three main stakeholders come to mind when discussing this topic.

The first is the federal government in Canada, as this stakeholder represents the main authority and decision-making entity in Canada. The primary motivation for the federal governmentis to achieve overall prosperity and success for Canada. This goal is also shared by the other stakeholders involved, although there are some minor differences as to what that means. The federal government also has a commitment to the broader international community due to the multiple climate commitments Canada has been a part of.

The second key stakeholder is the provincial governments within Canada. Provinces within Canada have constitutional power over the resources within their borders. As a result of this, decisions surrounding the environment in Canada must be made through a collaboration between provincial and federal governments. The provinces have an added interest, along with the prosperity of Canada, that being the prosperity of the provinces themselves. Typically, the leaders of each province will view their province as being properous meaning that Canada overall will be prosperous. This mentality will inevitably cause conflict with the federal government, as a decision must be reached that does not hurt one province while benefiting another.

The last key stakeholder is the Canadian population—more specifically, the populations of each province and those that would be impacted by the installation of green energy projects. This group is also further broken down into two sub-groups, with the Canadian population being separated into the “general Canadian” population and the First Nations communities that live throughout Canada. The "general Canadian" population is focused on individual economic prosperity—e.g., affordable goods, positive housing market, etc. This stakeholder is also focused on the broader prosperity of Canada, due to the mentality that a prosperous Canada means a prosperous Canadian. This mentallity is somewhat shared by the First-Nations population in Canada. They are focused on their individual prosperity, but there is the additional factor of their prosperity as First-Nations. This added layer means that decisions must respect First-Nations rights.

This mix of stakeholders and their various priorities can result in conflicts if navigated poorly.
