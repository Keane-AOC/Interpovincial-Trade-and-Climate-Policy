"Note: [A] 1990 emissions data for the Northwest Territories include emissions for Nunavut, which was part of the Northwest Territories until 1999. n/a = not applicable. Data are presented as rounded figures. However, all calculations have been performed using unrounded data. The years selected correspond to the first (1990) and last (2022) years of the dataset and to the base year (2005) for Canada's GHG emission reduction targets.",,,
